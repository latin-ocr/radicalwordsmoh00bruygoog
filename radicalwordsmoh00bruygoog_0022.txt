This clergyman, Father J ACQUES BRUYAs, of the Society of J eSUS,
a native of LyonS, came to Canada in 1666, arriving at Quebec on
the third of August. From the fourteenth of J uly 1767, when he set
0111 for the Mohawk, down to his death at the Mohawk mission of
Sault St.Louis‚ subsequent to 1700, 116 was constantly connected
with the missions among the Five Nations; spoke the Mohawk as
well as he did French3 and was regarded as the Master of the
language, in which he vcom-posed several works, besides the present
and other treatises on it. His abilities were admitted by all, not
only the writers of his order, but by Hennepin (who seems to have
perused this very manuscript), Earl Bellomont and Cotton Mather.
His knowledge of the various dialects of the Iroquois must have
been ,great indeed3 for after a short stay among the Mohawks in
1667, 116 was at Oneida from September 1667 10 16713 111611 among
the Mohawks till 1679, except in 1673, when 116 was in the Seneca
tribe. After this, 116 was chiefly at the Mission of 861111 81101118 011
1116 St.Lawrence. He was Superior of the Iroquois missions ,for se-
veral years,and Superior of all the missions in Canada from 1693
to 1700. ,Ι11 the negotiations between the French and Iroquois from
1699 10 1701, 116 took an active part, and visited New-York with

a letter announcing the termination of 110811111168. Η18 1681 appear-
ance in New-York was in 1700 and 17 01, 61 Onondaga.
