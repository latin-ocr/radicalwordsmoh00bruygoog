REPORT.

*

To the Legislature of the State of N ew·York.
THE Reng‘ents of the University respectfully report ε ¹

The collections· of the Gabinet continue in v‘the same excellent
condition of preservation, as at the date of the last report..Those
in zoology‚ particularly liable to the wdepredations of insects,
have been thoroughly examined‚ and were found to be entirely
uninjured. It has been deemed important, as far as practicable, to
procure skeletons, or at least the skulls of the animals represented
in the Collection. This work has been commenced, and every
opportunity of carrying it forward will be embraced. Among the
skeletons already obtained is that of the Moose, an animal which

is nearly'extinct in this State.

The arrangement of the specimens in palaeontology has been
completed‚ and the labelling'has been extended 38 far 38 1118
descriptione have· been made and the names fixed.

The expectations of considerable additions-to the collections
in economic geology, from the voluntary contributions of persons
engaged in converting rocks and minerals1to the uses of life, have
not been realized 3 and the Regents have become convinced that
this object can* be accomplished only by the earnest efforts of a
person fully comprehending and appreciating what 18 wanted, and
acting on a well-formed and fully-developed plan. Such a plan in
regard to the size and form of specimens, and their collection, is
already formed 3 and it is ,intended vigorously- to prosecute it,
with the hope and expectation of realizing, to some considerable
extent, during the present year, the objects proposed.

The printing of the grammatical and lexicographical treatise
>on the language of the Mohawks, communicated with the last
report, has not been completed‚ owing to a difficulty of obtaining
suitable type for s‘ome of the characters, It will be resumed and
attached to the present· report,

The contributions of Professor HALL to 'the Palaeontology of
the State are continued, and herewithsubmitted.

A list· of contributions and collections made by the Curator is

annexed.
Respectfully submitted,

By order of the Regents.
