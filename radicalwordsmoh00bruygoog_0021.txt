PREFACE·

’.ὼ

Tms volume contains undoubtedly the oldest grammatical or lexico«-
graphical treatise on the language of the Mohawks3 and although
but few of that tribe now reside in the State, the Mohawks occupy
a most important place in our early history, and undoubtedly decided
the sovereignty of New-York, and with it of most of North America.
The History of the Five NatiOHS, Hotinonsionni as they called

themselves, has been imperfectly written by COLDEN, and will here-
after afford a subject for a noble work.

The Iroquois left no monuments on our soil ε their language is
their real monument. The J esuit missionarieS, whO, from the days
of the devoted J ogues to the close of the seventeenth century, when
the cruel act of Bellomont prohibited any further attempt& to
christianise them, labored among the tribes, studied the various
dialects with the care and ability of educated men. Chaumonot wrote
a 'Huron grammar and works in Onondssa'ga, Carheil in Cayuga, and
Bruyas in Mohawk.

The present volume is one of the works of the last named, and
was written evidently in the latter part of the seventeenth century,
and most probably on the banks of the Mohawk. It is a closely

¹ written manuscript of 146 pages, which has been long preserved in
the Mission House at Oaughnawaga or Sault St.Louis near Montreal,

adding to the interest of the room where Charlevoix and Lafitau
wrote.

The grammatica] sketch is rather a series of notes. The main
work, the RAomEs Acmnnns, or Mohawk Radical WordS, comprises
the primitive words of the language, arranged in five conjUgationS,
with derivatives from each word, and examples in many cases of
great importance as explaining the manners, habits and ideas of the

people. Except in strict alphabetical arrangement, it is a very full

Mohawk Dictionary, written in Latin, but with the meaning of the
words in French.
